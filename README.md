# Description
The GearKnobs is a feature-rich Node.js Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to allow users to create, customize, and manage a variety of vehicle types, such as cars, trucks, and motorbikes. This application leverages the power of TypeScript and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a clean, organized, and scalable code structure.

# Overview
The GearKnobs provides users with an interactive CLI experience where they can define the key attributes of each vehicle, including make, model, year, color, weight, and even advanced features like towing capacity for trucks. This level of customization allows users to create detailed vehicle profiles and simulate real-world vehicle data.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local device. Run 'npm install' to get dependencies. Run 'npm start' to start the application.

# Usage

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies and launched the application, you can interact with the Vehicle-Builder CLI to create, customize, and manage different types of vehicles directly from your command line.

Creating or Selecting a Vehicle:
When prompted, you can either create a new vehicle or select an existing one to interact with.

Vehicle Creation:
Choose from one of three vehicle types: Car, Truck, or Motorbike. You'll then be asked to enter various details, including the vehicle's color, make, model, year, weight, and top speed. If you're creating a Truck, you'll also need to provide its towing capacity, and for a Motorbike, specify details for the front and rear wheels.

Vehicle Actions:
After selecting a vehicle, you can perform a variety of actions. These include:

Print details: Display detailed information about the selected vehicle.
Start vehicle: Ignite the vehicle's engine.
Accelerate 5 MPH / Decelerate 5 MPH: Increase or decrease the vehicleâ€™s speed incrementally.
Stop vehicle: Bring the vehicle to a complete stop.
Turn right / Turn left: Change the vehicle's direction.
Reverse: Move the vehicle in reverse.
Wheelie: (For Motorbikes only) Perform a wheelie stunt.
Tow: (For Trucks only) Tow another vehicle.
Select or create another vehicle: Return to the main menu to either choose a different vehicle or create a new one.
Exit: Close the application.
